# Betti Personal Brand Website (HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a warm-professional personal site that shows both:
- Your professional identity (software + cloud + teamwork), and
- Your human side (communication, leadership, balanced life), without oversharing.

## Quick setup
1) Unzip the folder.
2) Replace these placeholders in `index.html`:
   - `YOUR-LINK` with your LinkedIn slug
   - `YOUR-GITHUB` with your GitHub username
   - `YOUR-REPO` with your project repo links
3) Add your resume PDF as `resume.pdf` in the same folder (optional but recommended).
4) Add your headshot:
   - Put a professional photo at `assets/profile.jpg`
5) Optional “Life” photos:
   - Add `assets/life-1.jpg`, `assets/life-2.jpg`, `assets/life-3.jpg`

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
- Create a GitHub repo
- Upload these files
- Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch

## Notes
- Keep photos tasteful and professional.
- Keep descriptions short; recruiters skim in ~30–60 seconds.
